  # Use docker-based DNS server for the default bridge network instead of
  # the ones from /etc/resolv.conf if the host runs the dns-server role.
  # On hosts running the dns-server role localhost addresses (127.0.0.1 and
  # ::1) are added to /etc/resolv.conf by systemd-resolved. Since localhost
  # addresses cannot be accessed from inside a docker container, docker
  # would fall back to Google DNS servers.
  # Containers running on a custom network receive the network-specific DNS
  # provided by docker.
