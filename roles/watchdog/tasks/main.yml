#
# Each VM that should support a watchdog timer needs to have hardware that is
# currently not configurable on the Proxmox UI.
# Reference: https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Manual:_qm.conf
# Edit /etc/pve/qemu-server/<vmid>.conf and add:
#
# watchdog: model=i6300esb,action=reset
#
# Then stop and start the VM.
#
# It is possible to change the per-VM watchdog action on the Proxmox UI.
# Under VM / Monitor enter:
#
# watchdog_action debug
#
# To stop reporting to the watchdog and cause a reset, run this inside the VM
# (as root):
#
# echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger
#
# To monitor watchdog timers being fired (the debug action above), run this on
# the Proxmox host:
#
# journalctl --follow | grep watch
#
# To check whether a VM has access to /dev/watchdog hardware, run wdctl.
